# tagup-data-engineering-challenge

In this project I took the given data for each of the 4 sensors in SQL and mapped them to 4 pandas dataframes. I pivoted the dataframes so each column represented the values for a machine for the sensor corresponding to a table and each row is a timestamp. I then plotted and analyzed the data and found that there were outliers corresponding to sensor malfunctions, which made the values very large (absolute value of around 200 or over). I decided to replace this data with linearly interpolated data. I then found the time that each machine failed given the data for each sensor. I then looked at the mean and variance of the values of the machines before they failed. Finally, looking at the static data I noticed there were two types of machines so I split each dataframe up into two, one for each type of machine.
